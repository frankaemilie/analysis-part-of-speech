## Name
Analysis part of speech

## Description
Writing a code where the user is asked to give the name of a text file to analyse. The code should open the file, read each line and segmentate the lines into words. Each word having a length of at least 6 or more, a morpho-syntaxical analyse is done. This minimal morpho-syntaxical analyse is based on the suffixes having a length of at least 3 in order to identify if the word is a noun, an adjectif or an adverbe.
